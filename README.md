# Ideology_Research
Independent research conducted in order to measure U.S. Senate (2018-2020) representatives' ideology relative to the partisanship of their constituents.

For example, Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia is often criticized by more left-wing Democrats for being too conservative for the party, despite the fact that Senator Manchin behaves much more liberally than his constituents.

Using Python,  I utilized DW Nominate scores as a measure of Senators’ ideology, and Cook PVI scores to measure the ideology of their states. I then graphed the z score of each Senator’s DW Nominate against the z score of their states’ Cook PVI. In a world in which the nth most liberal/conservative state elected the nth most liberal/conservative senator, these two z scores would be very similar, and therefore the graph would appear as a straight line. 

Instead, my visualization showed that many Senators are much more conservative/liberal than their states’ ideology would predict. For example, the distance between Senator Manchin’s PVI z score and DW Nominate z score would indicate that his “value over replacement” to the Democratic Party, i.e. how much more liberal he is than a Senator one would predict West Virginians electing based on their ideology, is quite high.
